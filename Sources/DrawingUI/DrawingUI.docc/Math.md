# Math

## Overview

This doc talks about mathematics involved in drawing. 

### Data structs

This module adds additional functionality, conversion between, projections to/from normalized
* `BinaryFloatingPoing`/`FloatingPoint` (`CGFloat`, `Double`, `Float`, `Float32`, ``Float16``, `Float8`, etc...`)
* `CGPoint`
* `CGSize`
* `CGRect`
* `CGVector`
* `ClosedRange`

New structs:
* ``Line``
* ``CGLine``

Geometry: line, point, size, rect, vectors, circles, ellipses

Trigonometry: identities/functions, polar coordinates, waveforms, constructive interference 

Computations: dot product, polynomials, derivatives, integrals, tangents, normals, projection, interpoation, extrapolation, set theory

Algorithms: lerping, pascal's triangle, basis functions, bezier curves & splines, linear algebra (transforms), fast fourier transforms (forward and reverse)
